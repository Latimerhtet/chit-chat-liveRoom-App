**Live Room Chat Application**

Tech stack - MERN (MongoDB, Expressjs, React, Nodejs) and Socket.io

This application allows a group of rooms to chat together with friends. I used mainly socket.io for full-duplex communication.

In order to run server - npm start
In order to run client - npm run dev
